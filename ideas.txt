** Ideas **

Code needs to be as simple as possible.

Embed options youtube/twitch facebook maybe?

Viewer sign-in
create own account backend or use third party ex: Google identity or twitch api.

Simple front-end color changer. Ex: host is able to change site colors without knowing css.

Simple chat feature.

Discord/twitter live announcement
